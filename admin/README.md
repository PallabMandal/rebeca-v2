## Admin Dashboard Guidelines

Our App is successfully deployed and is currently accepting data in [admin.rebeca.in](https://admin.rebeca.in/)

Welcome to the Admin Dashboard designed for the admins of `Rebeca 84`. Below is a concise overview of its features and functionalities:

-   **Login and Authentication**: Admins must log in using their college email. Upon **first** login, a **passkey** will be required to validate admin status, which will be distributed to all admins shortly.
> Once Authenticated, passkey will not be required for successive login attempts.
-   **Profile Completion**: Complete your profile upon login to access dashboard features. Profile details can be edited at any time.

-   **Key Tasks**:
    -   **Add Event**: Make sure you have added yourself as a coordinator while adding an event.
    -   **Edit Event**: Only those admins who are added as coordinators for the event can view and edit this event.
    -   **View Registration Stats**: Admins can view and download participation data for events they coordinate.

-   **Mandatory Setup**: Admin setup is **mandatory** for data accuracy on the website (The teams page of [Rebeca Official Website](https://rebeca.in/) is fetched from whatever this App has Collected so far). There is also a plan to generate data for ID Card preparation, so it is suggested you keep your `tagLine` Field in Profile Details filled up to avoid any issues.
-   **Refresh**: Refresh the app to reflect updates that you perform, in case it is showing old data. Contact the admins if you face any difficulty.
-   **Developer Access**: Reserved for developers to handle technical issues. Contact the Dev Team for support.
